In this Post i will guide you through the steps i took when deploying an project to Netlify.

Netlify is similar to AWS another cloud service, they offer a huge free plan with up to 100GB/month of traffic. Moreover, I love them for their great user experience when it comes to deployment compared to AWS and Microsoft azure. Bellow, I will describe all the steps it takes to get your app up and running.

Af first sign in Using your Github account, then you will come to your home Page, I will describe their elements later.

#### Set up a Github CI

From the home menu click on create a new site and chose GitHub, authorize netlify to your GitHub account, and then chose either all repositories or just one, as I did on the left to install netlify.

In the next step choose the repository you want to build your site from.

In step 3 you need to specify your build settings, this highly depends on your application. When you are using **gridsome** your Build command is **gridsome Build** and the publish directory is dist.

When using **nuxt** it would be **nuxt Build**, the directory stays the same, and with **plain vue** it stays **npm run build.** Finding these commands for every other framework is also no rocket science and is normally described in the framework's documentation.

...And that's it! Hit **Deploy site** and netlify is doing the rest for you! Just wait a few minutes and your site is up and running. Awesome right?

#### Register a domain

When the Upload is done you can proceed with registring a domain for your Project. You could either use a third party service like amazon Route 53, which is a little cheaper from the second year on. Or use netlifys service and simply register it there and they handle all the DNS pain for you.

I have registered my domain directly within netlify, to complete I just hat to submit my payment information and confirm my purchase. After a few seconds, [https://www.the-koi.com/](https://www.the-koi.com/ "https://www.the-koi.com/") was up and running!

For your SSL certificate, you just have to click on verify DNS, then everything should be fine and you have a nice Trustful website online!

Reload after some minutes and your Domain managment tab Should look something like this:

#### Conclusion

Deploying your code to netlify takes really no time and you end up having a fast and secure server to serve your content.

Compared to WordPress you are also running on a budget, your only expenses are 13â‚¬ per year for the domain, and that's it!
