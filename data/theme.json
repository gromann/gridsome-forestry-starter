This will lead from solutions for simple software problems over articles about the startup life to building myself a passive income generating some financial certainty in the financially uncertain startUp life.<br>This journey took me a lot of perseverance, ambition, and courage but in the end, it will lead to success. That's also what the Koi stands for. <br>"
